This provided test data includes the following:
* Phylogenetic tree: Newick file with 413 tips
* Genotypic data: Matrix with 413 rows and 8X columns of genotypic data
* Isolate info & phenotypic data: Matrix with 413 rows and 3 columns. The following data will be necessary for analysis: isolate_no (corresponding to tip label), Patient_ID (corresponding to the patient), and kfoc_disrupted (whether the kfoC gene is disrupted)

This package's test data was taken from the following preprint [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258758). Data is hosted at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Snitkin-Lab-Umich/ltach-crkp-colistin-ms
