\title{nearest_neighbor_analysis: Generate nearest neighbor comparisons for isolate pairs}
\usage{
nearest_neighbor_analysis(
  comparison_df,
  categorical_vars = NULL,
  binary_vars = NULL,
  continuous_vars = NULL,
  log_2 = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comparison_df}{Dataframe with isolates and their nearest neighbors.}

\item{categorical_vars}{Categorical variables. Must be in the comparison_df}

\item{binary_vars}{Binary variables. Must be in the comparison_df AND coded 0 and 1.}

\item{continuous_vars}{Continuous variables. Must be in the comparison_df}

\item{log_2}{Boolean (TRUE/FALSE) Whether to perform log-2 transformation on continuous variables}
}
\value{
Dataframe with differences in the categorical and continuous variables between an isolate and their nearest neighbor
}
\description{
This function will compare the isolate to their nearest neighbor. Has functionality for categorical and continuous variables.
}
\details{
This function will use the phylogenetic tree to identify an isolate's nearest neighbor.
