\title{Enumeration of trait transitions using ancestral state reconstruction}
\usage{
asr_transition_analysis(parent_child_df, node_states = "joint")
}
\arguments{
\item{parent_child_df}{parent_child_df object returned from phyloAMR::asr()}

\item{node_states}{Whether 'joint' or 'marginal' reconstruction was used}
}
\value{
Dataframe with transition statistics for a trait.
}
\description{
Calculate transition statistics (e.g., gain, loss, and continuation) of an ancestral state reconstruction model.
Values include the number of transitions, gain events, loss events, continuation events, and the number of gains and losses at the tip.
Additional frequency statistics include the frequency of gain events (gains / parents without trait), loss events (losses / parents with trait), and the proportion of edges with continuation events.
